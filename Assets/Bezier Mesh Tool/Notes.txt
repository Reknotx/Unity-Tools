Notes for bezier mesh tool

1. Needs to generate bezier curves initially in the form of a cylinder.
1a. There will be multiple curves needed (Let's start off with three curves initially)
1b. The curves will be located bottom, middle, and on the top of the cylinder.

2. A cylinder needs be generated using the curves.
2a. The vertices will be offset based on the positioning of the curves.
2b. The vertices will need to be updated everytime the points are moved.
2c. The easiest method of generating the mesh would be to split it up into 3 individual pieces. (top, bottom, side)
2d. The normals will need to be calculated and normalized at the points where the vertices meet.

3. A texture needs to be displayed on the generated mesh.
3a. This will require a custom shader to be coded in.

4. The top and bottom of the cylinder will be initially flat.
4a. Extra vertices can be added to the mesh faces so that bumps can be added to 
make the mesh appear a bit uneven so it isn't a fully flat surface.
4b. A noise map can be generated to add small deformation to the face, but this is also unnecessary.
