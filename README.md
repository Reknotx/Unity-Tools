# Unity-Tools
A repository with multiple unity tools that are constructed for my purpose.
This repository is a large unity project that will contain several little side projects
and unique programming challenges, such as procedural mesh generation, planet generation, curve tools,
and many more unique tools. The purpose is to put together assets that can be utilized in production
to speed up several aspects of the process.
